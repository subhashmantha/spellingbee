    Base class for all Rio components.

    Components are the building blocks of all Rio apps. Rio already ships with
    many useful components out of the box, but you can also subclass
    `rio.Component` to create your own.

    Components all follow the same basic structure.

    - Class Header
    - Attribute (with type annotations!)
    - custom functions and event handlers
    - `build` method

    Here's a basic example

    ```python
    class HelloComponent(rio.Component):
        # List all of the components attributes here
        name: str

        # Define the build function. It is called when the component is created
        # or any of its attributes have changed
        def build(self) -> rio.Component:
            return rio.Text(f"Hello, {self.name}!")
    ```

    Notice that there is no `__init__` method. That's because all Rio components
    are automatically dataclasses. This means that you can just list the
    attributes of your component as class variables, and Rio will automatically
    create a constructor for you.

    In fact, **never write an `__init__` method for a Rio component** unless you
    know what you're doing. If you do need custom code to run during
    construction, **use the `__post_init__` method** instead. Here's another
    example, with a custom `__post_init__` method:

    ```python
    class HelloComponent(rio.Component):
        name: str
        greeting: str = ""

        # In order to run custom code during initialization, create a
        # `__post_init__` method. This method is called after all internal
        # setup is done, so you are free to access your finished component.
        def __post_init__(self) -> None:
            # If the caller hasn't provided a greeting, we'll make one up
            # based on the connected user's language
            if self.greeting:
                return

            if self.session.preferred_languages[0].startswith("de"):
                self.greeting = "Hallo"
            elif self.session.preferred_languages[0].startswith("es"):
                self.greeting = "Hola"
            elif self.session.preferred_languages[0].startswith("fr"):
                self.greeting = "Bonjour"
            else:
                self.greeting = "Hello"

        def build(self) -> rio.Component:
            return rio.Text(f"{self.greeting}, {self.name}!")
    ```

    This example initializes allows the user to provide a custom greeting, but
    if they don't, it will automatically choose a greeting based on the user's
    language. This needs custom code to run during initialization, so we use
    `__post_init__`.


    ## Attributes

    `key`: A unique identifier for this component. If two components with the
        same key are present during reconciliation they will be considered
        the same component and their state will be preserved. If no key is
        specified, reconciliation falls back to a less precise method, by
        comparing the location of the component in the component tree.

    `margin`: The margin around this component. This is a shorthand for
        setting `margin_left`, `margin_top`, `margin_right` and `margin_bottom`
        to the same value. If multiple conflicting margins are specified the
        most specific one wins. If for example `margin` and `margin_left` are
        both specified, `margin_left` is used for the left side, while the other
        sides use `margin`. Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a margin of
        1 is the height of a single line of text.

    `margin_x`: The horizontal margin around this component. This is a
        shorthand for setting `margin_left` and `margin_right` to the same
        value. If multiple conflicting margins are specified the most
        specific one wins. If for example `margin_x` and `margin_left` are
        both specified, `margin_left` is used for the left side, while the
        other side uses `margin_x`. Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a
        margin of 1 is the height of a single line of text.

    `margin_y`: The vertical margin around this component. This is a shorthand
        for setting `margin_top` and `margin_bottom` to the same value. If
        multiple conflicting margins are specified the most specific one
        wins. If for example `margin_y` and `margin_top` are both specified,
        `margin_top` is used for the top side, while the other side uses
        `margin_y`. Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a margin of 1 is
        the height of a single line of text.

    `margin_left`: The left margin around this component. If multiple
        conflicting margins are specified this one will be used, since it's
        the most specific. If for example `margin_left` and `margin` are
        both specified, `margin_left` is used for the left side, while the
        other sides use `margin`. Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a
        margin of 1 is the height of a single line of text.

    `margin_top`: The top margin around this component. If multiple
        conflicting margins are specified this one will be used, since it's
        the most specific. If for example `margin_top` and `margin` are both
        specified, `margin_top` is used for the top side, while the other
        sides use `margin`. Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a margin
        of 1 is the height of a single line of text.

    `margin_right`: The right margin around this component. If multiple
        conflicting margins are specified this one will be used, since it's
        the most specific. If for example `margin_right` and `margin` are
        both specified, `margin_right` is used for the right side, while the
        other sides use `margin`. Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a
        margin of 1 is the height of a single line of text.

    `margin_bottom`: The bottom margin around this component. If multiple
        conflicting margins are specified this one will be used, since it's
        the most specific. If for example `margin_bottom` and `margin` are
        both specified, `margin_bottom` is used for the bottom side, while
        the other sides use `margin`. Sizes are measured in "font heights", so
        a margin of 1 is the height of a single line of text.

    `width`: How much horizontal space this component should request during
        layouting. This can be either a number, or one of the special
        values:

        - If `"natural"`, the component will request the minimum amount it
          requires to fit on the screen. For example a `Text` will request
          however much space the characters of that text require. A `Row`
          would request the sum of the widths of its children.

        - If `"grow"`, the component will request all the remaining space in its parent.

        - Please note that the space a `Component` receives during layouting
          may not match the request. As a general rule, for example, containers
          try to pass on all available space to children. If you really want a
          `Component` to only take up as much space as requested, consider
          specifying an alignment.

        Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a width of 1 is the same as
        the height of a single line of text.

    `height`: How much vertical space this component should request during
        layouting. This can be either a number, or one of the special values:

        - If `"natural"`, the component will request the minimum amount it
          requires to fit on the screen. For example a `Text` will request
          however much space the characters of that text require. A `Row`
          would request the height of its tallest child.

        - If `"grow"`, the component will request all the remaining space in its
          parent.

        - Please note that the space a `Component` receives during layouting
          may not match the request. As a general rule for example, containers
          try to pass on all available space to children. If you really want a
          `Component` to only take up as much space as requested, consider
          specifying an alignment.

        Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a height of 1 is the same as
        the height of a single line of text.

    `align_x`: How this component should be aligned horizontally, if it
        receives more space than it requested. This can be a number between
        0 and 1, where 0 means left-aligned, 0.5 means centered, and 1 means
        right-aligned.

    `align_y`: How this component should be aligned vertically, if it receives
        more space than it requested. This can be a number between 0 and 1,
        where 0 means top-aligned, 0.5 means centered, and 1 means
        bottom-aligned.
