class Rectangle(FundamentalComponent):

    A customizable rectangle shape.

    Rectangles are versatile components that can be used as building blocks to
    create more complex elements. While not particularly interesting on their
    own, combining a rectangle with other components allows you to quickly
    create custom buttons, cards, or anything else you may need in your app.

    Rectangles also act as a simple source of animations. They have two styles:
    A default style for when the user isn't interacting with them, and a hover
    style for when the mouse hovers above them. This, along with their
    `transition_time` attribute allows you to make your app feel dynamic and
    alive.

    Because rectangles are meant as low-level building blocks, rather than full
    fledged components, they don't automatically switch the theme context for
    you. It's generally recommended to use `rio.Card` instead of `rio.Rectangle`
    unless you need the extra control that `rio.Rectangle` provides. You can
    find more details about theme contexts in the [Theming Quickstart
    Guide](https://rio.dev/docs/howto/theming-guide).


    ## Attributes

    `content`: The component to display inside the rectangle.

    `fill`: The background color/image/gradient of the rectangle.

    `stroke_width`: The width of the rectangle's outline.

    `stroke_color`: The color of the rectangle's outline.

    `corner_radius`: The rectangle's corner radius. Can be a single number or a
        sequence of 4 numbers.

    `shadow_radius`: The corner radius of the rectangle's shadow.

    `shadow_offset_x`: The horizontal offset of the rectangle's shadow. A
        negative value moves the shadow to the left side of the rectangle.

    `shadow_offset_y`: The vertical offset of the rectangle's shadow. A
        negative value moves the shadow above the rectangle.

    `shadow_color`: The color of the rectangle's shadow.

    `hover_fill`: The rectangle's `fill` while the cursor is hovering over it.

    `hover_stroke_width`: The rectangle's `stroke_width` while the cursor is
        hovering over it.

    `hover_stroke_color`: The rectangle's `stroke_color` while the cursor is
        hovering over it.

    `hover_corner_radius`: The rectangle's `corner_radius` while the cursor is
        hovering over it.

    `hover_shadow_radius`: The rectangle's `shadow_radius` while the cursor is
        hovering over it.

    `hover_shadow_offset_x`: The rectangle's `shadow_offset_x` while the cursor
        is hovering over it.

    `hover_shadow_offset_y`: The rectangle's `shadow_offset_y` while the cursor
        is hovering over it.

    `hover_shadow_color`: The rectangle's `shadow_color` while the cursor is
        hovering over it.

    `transition_time`: How many seconds it should take for the rectangle to
        transition between its regular and hover styles.

    `cursor`: The cursor to display when the mouse hovers above the rectangle.

    `ripple`: Whether to display a Material Design ripple effect when the
        rectangle is hovered or clicked.


    ## Examples

    Here's a minimal example of a rectangle with a text and green background:

    ```python
    rio.Rectangle(
        content=rio.Text("Hello World!", justify="center"),
        fill=rio.Color.GREEN,
    )
    ```

    You can also fill your `Rectangle` with an image instead of a color:

    ```python
    from pathlib import Path

    PATH = Path(__file__).parent

    rio.Rectangle(
        fill=rio.ImageFill(
            PATH / "example_image.jpg",
            fill_mode="zoom",
        ),
    )
    ```

    Also, note that the content is optional. You don't have to add anything if
    you just want a simple rectangle.
