    Holds information regarding a drawer open or close event.

    This is a simple dataclass that stores useful information for when the user
    opens or closes a drawer. You'll typically received this as argument in
    `on_open_or_close` events.

    A container which slides in from the edge of the screen.

    Drawers are containers which can either be completely hidden from view, or
    be made visible by sliding in from the edge of the screen. They are commonly
    used for navigation on smaller displays.

    Drawers take two children: The `anchor` is always visible and positions the
    drawer. The `content` is located inside the drawer and is only visible when
    the drawer is open.

    Drawers have the ability to be `modal`. Modal drawers draw attention to
    themselves and prevent interaction with the anchor while open.


    ## Attributes

    `anchor`: A component which is always visible and positions the drawer.

    `content`: A component which is only visible when the drawer is open.

    `on_open_or_close`: Triggered whenever the user opens or closes the
        drawer.

    `side`: The side of the screen from which the drawer slides in.

    `is_modal`: Whether the drawer should prevent interaction with the anchor
        while open.

    `is_open`: Whether the drawer is currently open.

    `is_user_openable`: Whether the user can open or close the drawer. If this
        is `False`, the drawer can only be opened or closed
        programmatically.

    `color`: The color scheme to use for the drawer content. The drawer itself
        will use the specified color, while content will automatically use one
        that is legible on top of it. This has no effect on the anchor.


    ## Examples

    A simple drawer with a button as the anchor and some text as content:

    ```python
    rio.Drawer(
        anchor=rio.Button("Click Me!"),
        content=rio.Text("It was clickbait!"),
    )
    ```

    Same as above, but wired so the drawer opens when the button is clicked:

    ```python
    class MyComponent(rio.Component):
        is_open: bool = False

        def on_press_button(self) -> None:
            self.is_open = True

        def build(self) -> rio.Component:
            return rio.Drawer(
                anchor=rio.Button(
                    "Click Me!",
                    on_press=self.on_press_button,
                ),
                content=rio.Text(
                    "It was clickbait!",
                ),
                is_open=self.is_open,
