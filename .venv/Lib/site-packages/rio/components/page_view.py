    Placeholders for pages.

    Rio apps can consist of many pages. You might have a welcome page, a
    settings page, a login, and so on. Page views act as placeholders, that
    don't have an appearance of their own, but instead look up the currently
    active page and display that.


    ## Attributes

    `fallback_build`: A callback that is called if the current URL does not
        correspond to any page in the application. It should return a Rio
        component that is displayed instead. If not specified Rio will
        display a default error page.


    ## Examples

    A minimal example:

    ```python
    app = rio.App(
        build=lambda: rio.Column(
            rio.Text("Welcome to my page!"),
            rio.PageView(
                height="grow",
            ),
        ),
        pages=[
            rio.Page(
                name="Home",
                page_url="",
                build=lambda: rio.Text("This is the home page"),
            ),
            rio.Page(
                name="Subpage",
                page_url="subpage",
                build=lambda: rio.Text("This is a subpage"),
            ),
        ],
    )

    app.run_in_browser()
    ```

    This will display "This is the home page" when navigating to the root URL,
    but "This is a subpage" when navigating to "/subpage". Note that on both
    pages the text "Welcome to my page!" is displayed above the page content.
    That's because it's not part of the `PageView`.
