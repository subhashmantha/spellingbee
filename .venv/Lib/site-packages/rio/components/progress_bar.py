class ProgressBar(FundamentalComponent):
    """
    A progress indicator in the shape of a horizontal bar.

    `ProgressBar` conveys to the user that activity is ongoing. It can either
    display the exact progress as a fraction from 0 to 1, or it can display an
    indeterminate progress animation, which is useful when the exact progress
    isn't known.

    The circular counterpart to this component is the `ProgressCircle`.


    ## Attributes

    `progress`: The progress to display, as a fraction from 0 to 1. If `None`,
        the progress indicator will be indeterminate.

    `color`: The color scheme of the progress indicator. Keeping the default
        is recommended, but it may make sense to change the color in
        case the default is hard to perceive on your background.

    `rounded`: Whether the corners of the progress bar should be rounded.

    ## Examples

    Here's a minimal example displaying a progress circle that is 40% complete:

    ```python
    rio.ProgressBar(progress=0.4)
    ```

    You don't have to pass any progress to `rio.ProgressBar`. If you don't,
    it will indicate to the user that something is happening, without showing
    any specific progress.

    ```python
    rio.ProgressBar()
    ```
