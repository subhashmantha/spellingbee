class Page:
    """
    A routable page in a Rio app.

    Rio apps can consist of many pages. You might have a welcome page, a
    settings page, a login, and so on. `Page` components contain all information
    needed to display those pages, as well as to navigate between them.

    This is not just specific to websites. Apps might, for example, have
    a settings page, a profile page, a help page, and so on.

    Pages are passed directly to the app during construction, like so:

    ```python
    import rio

    app = rio.App(
        build=lambda: rio.Column(
            rio.Text("Welcome to my app!"),
            rio.PageView(height="grow"),
        ),
        pages=[
            rio.Page(
                name="Home",
                page_url="",
                build=lambda: rio.Text("This is the home page"),
            ),
            rio.Page(
                name="Subpage",
                page_url="subpage",
                build=lambda: rio.Text("This is a subpage"),
            ),
        ],
    )

    app.run_in_browser()
    ```

    This will display "This is the home page" when navigating to the root URL,
    but "This is a subpage" when navigating to "/subpage". Note that on both
    pages the text "Welcome to my page!" is displayed above the page content.
    That's because it's not part of the `PageView`.

    ## Attributes

    `name`: A human-readable name for the page. While the page itself doesn't
        use this value directly, it serves as important information for
        debugging, as well as other components such as navigation bars.

    `page_url`: The URL segment at which this page should be displayed. For
        example, if this is "subpage", then the page will be displayed at
        "https://yourapp.com/subpage". If this is "", then the page will be
        displayed at the root URL.

    `build`: A callback that is called when this page is displayed. It should
        return a Rio component.

    `icon`: The name of an icon to associate with the page. While the page
        itself doesn't use this value directly, it serves as additional
        information for other components such as navigation bars.

    `children`: A list of child pages. These pages will be displayed when
        navigating to a sub-URL of this page. For example, if this page's
        `page_url` is "page1", and it has a child page with `page_url` "page2",
        then the child page will be displayed at
        "https://yourapp.com/page1/page2".

    `meta_tags`: A dictionary of meta tags to include in the page's HTML. These
        are used by search engines and social media sites to display
        information about your page.

    `guard`: A callback that is called before this page is displayed. It
        can prevent users from accessing pages which they are not allowed to
        see. For example, you may want to redirect users to your login page
        if they are trying to access their profile page without being
        logged in.

        The callback should return `None` if the user is allowed to access
        the page, or a string or `rio.URL` if the user should be redirected
        to a different page.
