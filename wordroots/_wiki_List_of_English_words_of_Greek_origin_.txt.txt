vernacular borrowings, transmitted orally through Vulgar Latin directly into Old English, e.g., 'butter' (butere, from Latin butyrum &lt; βούτυρον), or through French, e.g., 'ochre';
learned borrowings from classical Greek texts, often via Latin, e.g., 'physics' (&lt; Latin physica &lt; τὰ φυσικά);
a few borrowings transmitted through other languages, notably Arabic scientific and philosophical writing, e.g., 'alchemy' (&lt; χημεία);
direct borrowings from Modern Greek, e.g., 'ouzo' (ούζο);
neologisms (coinages) in post-classical Latin or modern languages using classical Greek roots, e.g., 'telephone' (&lt; τῆλε + φωνή) or a mixture of Greek and other roots, e.g., 'television' (&lt; Greek τῆλε + English vision &lt; Latin visio); these are often shared among the modern European languages, including Modern Greek.
chair &lt;&lt; καθέδρα (cf. 'cathedra');
bishop &lt;&lt; epískopos (ἐπίσκοπος 'overseer');
priest &lt;&lt; presbýteros (πρεσβύτερος 'elder'); and
telescope &lt; τηλεσκόπος 'far-seeing', refers to an optical instrument for seeing far away rather than a person who can see far into the distance;
phlogiston &lt; φλογιστόν 'burnt thing', is a supposed fire-making potential rather than something which has been burned, or can be burned; and
bacterium &lt; βακτήριον 'stick (diminutive)', is a kind of microorganism rather than a small stick or staff.
utopia (1516; οὐ 'not' + τόπος 'place')[10]
zoology (1669; ζῷον + λογία)
hydrodynamics (1738; ὕδωρ + δυναμικός)
photography (1834; φῶς + γραφικός)
oocyte (1895; ᾠόν + κύτος)

gas (&lt; χάος chaos) is irregular both in formation and in spelling;
hadron &lt; ἁδρός with the suffix -on, itself abstracted from Greek anion (ἀνιόν);
henotheism &lt; ἑνό(ς) 'one' + θεός 'god', though heno- is not used as a prefix in Greek;
taxonomy &lt; τάξις 'order' + -nomy (-νομία 'study of'), where the "more etymological form" is taxinomy,[1][12] as found in ταξίαρχος, 'taxiarch', and the neologism taxidermy. Modern Greek uses ταξινομία in its reborrowing.[13]
psychedelic &lt; ψυχή 'psyche' + δηλοῦν 'make manifest, reveal'; the regular formation would be psychodelic[14] or psychodelotic;[15]

-oma &lt; -ωμα, a generic morpheme forming deverbal nouns, such as diploma ('a folded thing') and glaucoma ('greyness'), comes to have the very narrow meaning of 'tumor' or 'swelling', on the model of words like carcinoma &lt; καρκίνωμα. For example, melanoma does not come from μελάνωμα 'blackness', but rather from the modern combining forms melano- ('dark' [in biology]) + -oma ('tumor').
-itis &lt; -ῖτις, a generic adjectival suffix; in medicine used to mean a disease characterized by inflammation: appendicitis, conjunctivitis, ..., and now facetiously generalized to mean "feverish excitement".[18]
-osis &lt; -ωσις, originally a state, condition, or process; in medicine, used for a disease.[18]
-athon or -a-thon (from the portmanteau word walkathon, from walk + (mar)athon).
-ase, used in chemistry for enzymes, is abstracted from diastase, where -ασις is not a morpheme at all in Greek.
-on for elementary particles, from electron: lepton, neutron, phonon, ...

aneurysm was formerly often spelled aneurism on the assumption that it uses the usual -ism ending.
If it includes ph pronounced as /f/ or y between consonants, it is very likely Greek, with some exceptions, such as nephew, cipher, triumph.[26]
If it includes rrh, phth, or chth; or starts with hy-, ps-, pn-, or chr-; or the rarer pt-, ct-, chth-, rh-, x-, sth-, mn-, tm-, gn- or bd-, then it is Greek, with some exceptions: gnat, gnaw, gneiss.
ptarmigan is from a Gaelic word, the p having been added by false etymology;
style is probably written with a 'y' because the Greek word στῦλος 'column' (as in peristyle, 'surrounded by columns') and the Latin word stilus, 'stake, pointed instrument', were confused.

'Greek', p. 453-454 
^ This must have been an early borrowing, since the Latin v reflects a still-pronounced digamma; the earliest attested form of it is the Mycenaean Greek 𐀁𐀨𐀷, e-ra3-wo 'elaiwo(n)', attested in Linear B syllabic script. (see C.B. Walker, John Chadwick, Reading the Past: Ancient Writing from Cuneiform to the Alphabet, 1990, ISBN 0520074319, p. 161) The Greek word was in turn apparently borrowed from a pre-Indo-European Mediterranean substrate; cf. Greek substrate language. 
^ Carl Darling Buck, A Dictionary of Selected Synonyms in the Principal Indo-European Languages (ISBN 0-226-07937-6) notes that the word has the form of a compound βοΰς + τυρός 'cow-cheese', possibly a calque from Scythian, or possibly an adaptation of a native Scythian word.

^ The 14th-century Byzantine monk Neophytos Prodromenos independently coined the word in Greek in his Against the Latins, with the meaning 'absurdity'.
