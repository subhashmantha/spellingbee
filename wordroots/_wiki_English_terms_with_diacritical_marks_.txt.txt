the acute accent (née) and grave accent (English poetry marking, changèd), modifying vowels or marking stresses
the circumflex (entrepôt), borrowed from French
the diaeresis (Zoë), indicating a second syllable in two consecutive vowels
the tittle, the dot found on the regular small i and small j, is removed when another diacritic is required
the macron (English poetry marking, lēad pronounced /liːd/, not /lɛd/), lengthening vowels, as in Māori; or indicating omitted n or m (in pre-Modern English, both in print and in handwriting).
the breve (English poetry marking, drŏll pronounced /drɒl/, not /droʊl/), shortening vowels
the umlaut (über), altering Germanic vowels
the cedilla (soupçon, façade), in French, Portuguese and in Catalan it is a softening c, indicating 's-' not 'k-' pronunciation
the tilde (Señor, João), in Spanish indicating palatalised n, and Portuguese indicating nasal a and o (although in Spanish and most source languages, the tilde is not considered a diacritic over the letter n but rather as an integral part of the distinct letter ñ; in Portuguese the sound is represented by "nh")
the háček (as in Karel Čapek), often also called the haček in English (adapted from "háček", the Czech name, meaning "little hook".[a]), as Č/č, Š/š, Ř/ř (only in Czech), Ž/ž broadly turns "c" "s" "r" "z" into English "ch" "sh" "rzh"[b] "zh"  sounds respectively, and Ď/ď, Ľ/ľ (only in Slovak), Ň/ň and Ť/ť turn "/d/" "/l/" "/n/" and "/t/" into palatal "/ɟ/" "/ʎ/" "/ɲ/" and "/c/" sounds. In most fonts the caron looks like an apostrophe sitting inside the Slovak capital L, as "Ľ", but in fact is only another form of caron.
the Polish crossed Ł and ogonek (as in Lech Wałęsa) – the former pronounced as English "w", the latter with varying pronunciation (see Ę and Ą)
the Serbo-Croatian Latin crossed Đ (as in Franjo Tuđman or Zoran Đinđić), equivalent to the Cyrillic letter Dje
the Maltese crossed Ħ (as in the Ħal- town prefix, Ħal Far Industrial Estate), a hard H
the Danish and Norwegian crossed Ø (as in Galdhøpiggen); the front rounded O, which is written with an umlaut in Swedish and German
the Norwegian, Danish and Swedish over-ring Å (as in Åland), the å vowel sound (usually /ͻː/)
the Romanian Ș (as in Chișinău), the voiceless postalveolar fricative
ċ is used for a voiceless palato-alveolar affricate /t͡ʃ/
ġ for a palatal approximant /j/ (probably a voiced palatal fricative /ʝ/ in the earliest texts)
Grave accents and macrons are used in some orthographies of Cumbrian in words such as steàn "stone", seùner "sooner" and pūnd "pound".[19]
Diaereses are used in the Lincolnshire dialect, for example stoän "stone", goä "go" and maäke "make".[20]
Grave accents, circumflexes and diaereses are used in the Dorset dialect, in words such as mornèn "morning", drîth "dryness" or "drought" and ceäkes "cakes".
