via the silk road, e.g. silk. These have heavy influence from countries along the silk road.
via the missionaries who lived in China. These have heavy Latin influence due the Portuguese and Spanish missionaries.
via the sinologists who lived in China. These have heavy French influence due to the long history of French involvement in Sinology.
via the maritime trade route, e.g. tea, Amoy, cumshaw etc. These have heavy influence from the Amoy dialect in southern seaports.
via the early immigrants to the US in the gold rush era, e.g. chop suey. These have heavy influence from the Toisan dialect.
via the multi-national colonization of Shanghai. These have influence from many European countries, also Japan.

via modern international communication especially after the 1970s when the People's Republic of China opened its iron curtain to let her people emigrate to various countries, e.g. wushu, feng shui etc. These have heavy influence from Mandarin.
via Japanese and (possibly) Korean and Vietnamese. These languages have borrowed large amounts of Chinese vocabulary in the past, written in the form of Chinese characters. The pronunciation of such loanwords is not based directly on Chinese, but on the local pronunciation of Chinese loanwords in these languages, known as Sino-Japanese, Sino-Korean, and Sino-Vietnamese. In addition, the individual characters were extensively used as building blocks for local neologisms with no counterpart in the original Chinese, resulting in words whose relationship to the Chinese language is similar to the relationship between new Latinate words (particularly those that form a large part of the International Scientific Vocabulary) and Latin. Such words are excluded from the list.
